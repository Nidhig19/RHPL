      The Indian Association for Research in Computing Science (IARCS) is pleased to announce the fourth edition of the Workshop on Research Highlights in Programming Languages (RHPL). The workshop will be co-located with FSTTCS 2025. The focus of this workshop (RHPL@FSTTCS) will be on all areas of Programming Languages, including but not limited to: program analysis and verification, applied formal methods, and compilers.

      The objective of the workshop is to foster interactions between the attendees of the workshop, and more broadly, between researchers working on programming languages and the traditional FSTTCS community of researchers working on theoretical computer science and formal methods. To facilitate this, we invite proposals for:

      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>
          Talks: based on recent work that has been published in reputed venues, or is mature in terms of approach and evaluation;
          </li>
          <li>Poster presentations: based on early ideas that are promising but have not been developed fully
        </li>
          
      </ul>

      In the long term we hope that RHPL will evolve into a regular conference or a track integrated with the FSTTCS conference.
